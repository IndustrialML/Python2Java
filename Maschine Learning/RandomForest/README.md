# Random Forest Python
Find the code and documentation for how to use a trained sklearn Random Forest for production. There are two possible approaches:
* **Inference as a Service**: Deploy the ML model from Python and offer an inference service as RESTful API ([IaaS](https://github.com/Matleo/MLPython2Java/tree/develop/Maschine%20Learning/RandomForest/IaaS))
* **Model as a Service**: Transfer the whole ML model from Python to Java, to execute predictions directly in Java ([MaaS](https://github.com/Matleo/MLPython2Java/tree/develop/Maschine%20Learning/RandomForest/MaaS))
